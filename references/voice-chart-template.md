# Braze voice chart

Use this voice chart to establish consistent brand personality across all UX text. The Braze voice always reflects who we are—empowering, straightforward, and human. Our **tone** flexes depending on the context to support users in a range of situations.

## Concept 1: empowering

**Voice characteristics**: Confident, encouraging, informative
**Description**: Braze gives users the confidence to take action. We explain the “why” and “how,” offer practical guidance, and make users feel capable—not overwhelmed. We respect their expertise while supporting continued growth.
**Do**:
- “Send a test message to see how your campaign looks in the inbox.”
- “To improve results, try adding more filters to your segment.”


**Don’t**:
- “Run a test to check if it works.”
- “Incorrect setup. Please fix before continuing.”


## Concept 2: straightforward

**Voice characteristics**: Clear, concise, specific
**Description**: We get to the point and use plain language. We provide just enough detail to help users succeed, and we’re specific about benefits and limits. We avoid fluff, filler, and vague marketing claims.
**Do**:
- “Your campaign was sent to 12,415 users.”
- “Only available in Canvas Flow.”

**Don’t**:
- “You’ve successfully launched your campaign!”
- “New editor exclusive feature you’re going to love.”

## Concept 3: human

**Voice characteristics**: Conversational, respectful, transparent
**Description**: We sound like people—never robotic, never overly casual. We write in plain English and with empathy. We acknowledge emotions without assuming them and are honest, especially when something goes wrong.
**Do**:
- “Looks like this page isn’t available. Try refreshing or head back to the dashboard.”
- “This prediction didn’t run. Try selecting a different event.”

**Don’t**:
- “404 error: Page not found.”
- “Prediction build failed. Invalid data.”

## Implementation notes

- Use sentence case for all UI elements—headings, buttons, links, and so on.
- Use preferred terms such as:
  - **add**, **accept**, **turn on**, **archive**, **personalize** (for Liquid-powered content)
- Avoid terms such as:
    - **enable/disable**, **kill**, **invalid**, **dismiss**, **whitelist/blacklist**
- Use inclusive terms like **allowlist/blocklist**
- Replace directional cues (“above,” “below”) with contextual ones (“in this section,” “on the next screen”)
