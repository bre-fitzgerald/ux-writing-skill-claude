## For Non-Technical Contributors

**New to GitHub?** No problem! You don't need to be a developer to contribute. Here are simple ways to share your expertise:

### Option 1: Open an Issue

1. **Go to the repository** on GitHub
2. **Click the "Issues" tab** at the top
3. **Click the green "New issue" button**
4. **Describe your contribution**:
   - Paste your suggested text or example
   - Explain what it improves or adds
   - Include any context that's helpful
5. **Click "Submit new issue"**

That's it! A maintainer will review and incorporate your contribution.

### Option 2: Edit Files Directly on GitHub

You can edit files right in your browser without installing anything:

1. **Navigate to the file you want to edit** (like `examples/real-world-improvements.md`)
2. **Click the pencil icon** (✏️) in the top right corner
3. **Make your changes** in the editor
4. **Scroll down** to the "Propose changes" section
5. **Write a brief description** of what you changed
6. **Click "Propose changes"** (green button)
7. **Click "Create pull request"** on the next screen

GitHub will handle the technical parts automatically. A maintainer will review your changes and merge them.

### Option 3: Send It Directly

If GitHub feels overwhelming, you can:

- **Email your contribution** to the maintainer (see README for contact)
- **Share a Google Doc** with your suggested additions
- **Post in community channels** where this skill is discussed

Someone will help get your contribution into the repository.

### What Makes a Good Contribution?

Whether you're submitting an issue or editing directly:

- **Be specific**: Instead of "add more examples," share the actual example
- **Explain the value**: Why is this helpful? What problem does it solve?
- **Keep it realistic**: Use examples from actual products when possible
- **Follow the existing format**: Look at similar content and match the style

### Don't Worry About Perfection

Submit your idea even if:
- You're not sure about the formatting
- Your example isn't polished yet
- You're uncertain if it fits

Maintainers can help refine it. The hard part is having the expertise — you have that!

### Need Help?

Stuck on something? Open an issue with the title "Help: [what you need]" and describe where you're stuck. The community is here to help.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Content Standards

All contributions should follow these principles:

1. **Evidence-based**: Based on established UX writing best practices or user research
2. **Actionable**: Provides clear, practical guidance
3. **Concise**: Respects the reader's time
4. **Well-structured**: Easy to scan and reference
5. **Example-rich**: Shows, doesn't just tell

### Style Guidelines

- Use sentence case for headings
- Use em dashes (—) not hyphens (-) for breaks
- Keep examples realistic and specific
- Include both "do" and "don't" examples where helpful
- Score examples against the four quality standards when relevant
